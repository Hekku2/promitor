# Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) project, is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm install stable/prometheus
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.3+ with Beta APIs enabled

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install --name my-release stable/prometheus
```

The command deploys Prometheus on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Prometheus chart and their default values.

Parameter | Description | Default
--------- | ----------- | -------
`alertmanager.enabled` | If true, create alertmanager | `true`
`alertmanagerFiles.alertmanager.yml` | Prometheus alertmanager configuration | example configuration

### ConfigMap Files
AlertManager is configured through [alertmanager.yml](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/). This file (and any others listed in `alertmanagerFiles`) will be mounted into the `alertmanager` pod.

Prometheus is configured through [prometheus.yml](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/). This file (and any others listed in `serverFiles`) will be mounted into the `server` pod.
